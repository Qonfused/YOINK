This project aims to (i) replicate capabilities of larger closed-source <strong>Large-Language-Models (LLMs)</strong> through various <strong>transfer-learning</strong> techniques, (ii) explore better strategies for generating <strong>diverse instruction data</strong>, and (iii) provide an <strong>extensible model architecture and API</strong> to facilitate academic research on large-language models.
<br><br>
YOINK is developed in <a href=https://github.com/google/tensorflow>Tensorflow</a> with API compatibility for <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> + <a href="https://github.com/google/flax">Flax</a>.
