title: "YOINK, Yielding Optimized Inductive Knowledge"
abstract: YOINK is an open-source framework for tuning smarter and cheaper large-language models. The project aims to (i) replicate capabilities of larger closed-source Large-Language-Models (LLMs) through various transfer-learning techniques, (ii) explore better strategies for generating diverse instruction data, and (iii) provide an extensible model architecture and API to facilitate academic research on large-language models. YOINK is developed in Tensorflow with API compatibility for JAX + Flax.
